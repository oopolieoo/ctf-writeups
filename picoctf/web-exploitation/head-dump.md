Challenge Overview

This challenge provided a hosted web instance that required the user to locate a hidden endpoint that would reveal a flag. The objective was to enumerate the site and identify exposed resources that would allow the user to retrieve sensitive information. This CTF is categorized as web exploitation and is rated as easy.

Initial Analysis

The first thing I did was launch the instance and perform basic reconnaissance. My initial thought was to explore the site’s cookies to check for things like session data or any important stored values. There was no useful information, so I moved on to inspecting the source code to look for any suspicious comments, hidden routes, or insecure backend functionality.

Enumeration

While reviewing the source code, I noticed a link pointing to an endpoint labeled /api-docs. This stood out as an attack surface, as API documentation is not often left unsecured since it can reveal sensitive information.

Upon navigating to the /api-docs endpoint, I discovered a section labeled “Diagnostics,” which contained a reference to a resource labeled heapdump. Given the name of the CTF, I knew I was looking in the right place. I requested the linked resource, which downloaded a .heapsnapshot file onto my machine.

My first attempt was to open the file; however, it was unreadable in its original format. I had not seen a .heapsnapshot file extension before, so I did a quick search to understand its purpose. My search revealed that these files are JSON-formatted, which immediately suggested this could be a file obfuscation challenge. In the past, I have completed CTFs that required changing a file extension to reveal additional information. Based on this, I changed the .heapsnapshot extension to .json. This revealed a plaintext file which, upon inspection, contained the flag and completed the challenge.

Lessons Learned

In this challenge, I gained my first experience working with .heapsnapshot files. I now have a solid understanding of their purpose and how to inspect them in future challenges. Converting the file extension to reveal sensitive information reinforced the importance of recognizing file structures and understanding how simple transformations can expose meaningful data.
